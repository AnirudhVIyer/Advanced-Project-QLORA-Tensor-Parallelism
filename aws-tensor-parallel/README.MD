Experiment 1 AWS Tensor Parallelism

We make use of the AWS Sagemaker training instances to setup the distributed experiment setup.
Start a sagemaker notebook, and copy the script files under -/shared scripts. Run the sagemaker_exp_notebook.ipynb
to run the experiment. 

Notebook Details:
You can control the hyperparameters of the training through the notebook.
Set the specific degree of Tensor Parallelism you want to achieve.
